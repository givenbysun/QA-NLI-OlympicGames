# QA-NLI-OlympicGames
This project is a Natural Language Interface to a Database of Olympic Games. The main idea is to first derive a semantic representation from the syntactic trees of the parsed input questions. Then build a small interpreter that uses the semantic representation to create a SQL query using semantic attachments. Executing this query on the database would provide answer to user.
